Keep very large files (screen recordings, rendered videos, anything near GitHub's 100 MB limit) out of git.
Source recordings and rendered videos live in `~/Documents` (where Tiran puts the source video and SRT);
a HyperFrames project under `videos/` references the recording through a symlink that `.gitignore` excludes
(`videos/*/assets/walkthrough.mp4`, `videos/**/*.mp4`, `videos/*/.hyperframes/`, `videos/*/renders/`).

**Why:** on 2026-10-13 `git push origin main` was rejected because `videos/caruca-naive-run-1/assets/walkthrough.mp4`
(169 MB) was in an unpushed commit. Fixed by replacing it with a symlink and amending that one unpushed commit.

**How to apply:** when staging media into a repo project, symlink or copy it to `~/Documents` instead, render with
`-o ~/Documents/...`, and check `git ls-tree -r -l HEAD` for files over ~50 MB before telling Tiran a commit is pushable.
